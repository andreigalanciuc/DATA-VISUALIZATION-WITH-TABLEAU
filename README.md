# DATA-VISUALIZATION-WITH-TABLEAU

## SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
You will need `Tableau Pulic` or `Tableau Desktop` to visualize this project.

## PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS
With this data visualisation, I want to understand the relation between the physical features of baseball players and their home run performances. I investigate this relation based on their heights, weights and handedness.

## RESULTS SUMMARY
Height and weight of the players have normal distributions.
The best home run performance was achieved by players with a weight between 180 and 200 pounds, and a height between 71 and 76 inches.
